VOICE CONTROL RULES

Use the following voice control commands inline to modulate TTS (they will be parsed and applied by TTS, then hidden in UI):

{rate:+X%} / {rate:-X%}  - speaking rate
{volume:+X%} / {volume:-X%}  - volume
{pitch:+XHz} / {pitch:-XHz}  - pitch

Guidelines:
- Keep commands concise and only when needed
- Prefer presets from Emotion Presets if applicable
- Do not overuse; keep speech natural
